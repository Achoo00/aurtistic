## **2. User Authentication & Authorization (P0)**

These tasks focus on securing the application for trusted users.

* [ ] **2.1. Implement User Sign-In/Sign-Up:**

  * [ ] Create a basic sign-in page using Supabase Auth.
  * [ ] Integrate sign-up functionality (though users will be manually added by admin).
* [ ] **2.2. Implement User Sign-Out:**

  * [ ] Add a sign-out mechanism.
* [ ] **2.3. Protect Routes:**

  * [ ] Ensure all core application pages (gallery, upload) are only accessible to authenticated users.
* [ ] **2.4. Admin User Management (Manual):**

  * [ ] Document the process for the Admin (David) to manually add new users via the Supabase dashboard.
* [ ] **2.5. Password Reset Flow:**

  * [ ] Verify the Supabase Auth password reset by email functionality.

## **3. Image Management & Gallery (P0)**

This section covers the core functionality of displaying and handling artworks.

* [ ] **3.1. Supabase Image Upload Integration:**

  * [ ] Develop a server-side or client-side function to handle secure image uploads to Supabase Storage.
  * [ ] Ensure metadata (title, description, tags, artist, date) is captured and stored in the PostgreSQL database upon successful upload.
* [ ] **3.2. Responsive Gallery Grid View:**

  * [ ] Fetch artwork data from Supabase PostgreSQL.
  * [ ] Display all artworks in a responsive grid layout.
  * [ ] Implement Next.js Image component for optimized image loading and performance (including CDN delivery via Supabase Storage).
* [ ] **3.3. Detail View/Modal:**

  * [ ] Create a modal or dedicated detail page that displays the full image and all associated metadata (title, artist, tags, date\_uploaded, description) when an artwork is selected from the gallery.

## **4. Search & Filtering (P0)**

Enabling users to find specific artworks.

* [ ] **4.1. Filter UI Implementation:**

  * [ ] Develop UI elements for filtering by:

    * [ ] Artist (dropdown or searchable list)
    * [ ] Tags (multi-select or searchable list)
    * [ ] Date (monthly groupings, e.g., "June 2025," "May 2025")
  * [ ] Integrate filtering logic to update the displayed gallery based on selections.
* [ ] **4.2. Basic Search Bar:**

  * [ ] Implement a search bar that allows users to search by artwork title and description.
  * [ ] Integrate search logic to filter the displayed artworks.

* [ ] **5.3. Image Optimization:**

  * [ ] Verify Next.js Image component's optimization features (lazy loading, responsive sizing, image formats) are correctly implemented.
  * [ ] Conduct performance testing to ensure load times are under 2 seconds on 3G mobile.

## **6. Deployment & Quality Assurance (P0)**

Getting the application live and ensuring it works well.

* [ ] **6.1. Initial Vercel Deployment:**

  * [ ] Deploy the developed features to Vercel for testing.
* [ ] **6.2. Cross-Browser Compatibility Testing:**

  * [ ] Test the application on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and various mobile browsers.
* [ ] **6.3. Accessibility (WCAG AA) Checks:**

  * [ ] Perform basic accessibility checks to ensure compliance.
* [ ] **6.4. Security Review:**

  * [ ] Confirm only authenticated users can upload and access the gallery.
  * [ ] Verify no public user data is exposed.
* [ ] **6.5. Performance Benchmarking:**

  * [ ] Measure page load times on different network conditions to ensure targets are met.
